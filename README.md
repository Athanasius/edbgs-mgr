# Elite Dangerous - Background Simulation (BGS) Management Tools

This project relates to the computer game
[Elite Dangerous](https://www.elitedangerous.com/) by
[Frontier Developments](https://www.frontier.co.uk/).

It provides a set of tools to make managing a Minor Faction within the
game's BackGround Simulation (BGS) less tedious.  The aim is to allow
you more time to *play* rather than managing spreadsheets or determining
necessary actions by hand.

## Introduction
There are several aims to this project:

1. Take the tedium out of ensuring you have timely data for making
   decision.

1. Automated alerts for where necessary actions need to be performed to
   achieve desired BGS outcomes.

The [API](https://elitebgs.app/ebgs/) of
[Elite BGS](https://elitebgs.app/) is used as the data source.  Thus
these tools 100% rely on that tool having up to date data.  It receives
data from [EDDN](https://github.com/EDCD/EDDN).  To learn how to send
data to EDDN consult
[EDCD: CMDR's Guide](https://edcd.github.io/cmdrs-guide.html).
